# Bitcoin Market Sentiment & Trader Performance Analysis

This project analyzes the relationship between Bitcoin market sentiment, as measured by the **Fear & Greed Index**, and the trading performance of users on the **Hyperliquid platform**. The objective is to uncover patterns in trader profitability and behavior under different market conditions (e.g., Fear, Greed, Neutral) to inform smarter, sentiment-aware trading strategies.

## Key Findings

1.  **Peak Performance During Extreme Greed**: Traders achieved the highest average profits **(\$67.89/trade)** and the highest win rate **(46.5%)** during periods of 'Extreme Greed', suggesting that peak market optimism correlated with the best trading outcomes in this dataset.

2.  **Lowest Profitability in Neutral Markets**: The lowest average profitability **(\$34.31/trade)** occurred during 'Neutral' periods, indicating that a lack of clear market direction was more challenging for traders than periods of high fear.

3.  **Top Traders Capitalize on Greed**: The top 20% of traders (by total PnL) significantly outperformed others during 'Greed' and 'Extreme Greed' phases. This demonstrates their ability to effectively capitalize on market optimism and momentum.

4.  **Weak Correlation with Trade Size**: The analysis revealed a very weak correlation between sentiment score and the size of trades, suggesting that profitability was not simply a function of placing larger bets in certain market conditions but likely depended on strategy.
