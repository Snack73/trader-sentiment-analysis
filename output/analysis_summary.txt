This analysis reveals a distinct relationship between market sentiment and trading performance.
Traders achieved the highest average profits ($67.89/trade) and the highest
win rate (46.5%) during periods of 'Extreme Greed'. This indicates that during
peak market optimism, trades were both more frequently profitable and generated higher returns
on average. Conversely, the lowest average profitability occurred during 'Neutral'
periods, suggesting traders should exercise increased caution when market sentiment is neutral or fearful.
